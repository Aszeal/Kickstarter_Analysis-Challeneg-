## Overview of Project
The overview of the project was to analyze the "Kick Starter" data and formulate a conconlusion based of the analytics using visualizations and a report. The project is focused on showcasing my ability to analyze the date, organize it, and make it clear for the reader to understand. 

## Purpose of the Project 
The purpose of the project was to analyze the "Kick Starter" data and formulate a conconlusion based of the analytics. In this particular case, I was directed to analysis data in comparison to Louises' play, *Fever*. Louise wanted to know how his play did in comparison to others. His play almost met the fundraising goal.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
With undergoing any new challenges, there will be difficulties. In this case, the difficulties I faced was making sure the data was sifted correctly and catagorized with the correct filters. Another difficulty was making sure my formulas were outputting the correct information. Lastly, one possible difficulty that I could have encountered would have been using incorrect data from the source. In other words, if the data that was given was incorrect from the start, then all of the visualizations and report(s) would be wrong. 
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
