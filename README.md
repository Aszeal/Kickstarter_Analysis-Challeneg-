## Overview of Project
The overview of the project was to analyze the "Kick Starter" data and formulate a conconlusion based of the analytics using visualizations and a report. The project is focused on showcasing my ability to analyze the date, organize it, and make it clear for the reader to understand. 

## Purpose of the Project 
The purpose of the project was to analyze the "Kick Starter" data and formulate a conconlusion based of the analytics. In this particular case, I was directed to analysis data in comparison to Louises' play, *Fever*. Louise wanted to know how his play did in comparison to others. His play almost met the fundraising goal.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
With undergoing any new challenges, there will be difficulties. In this case, the difficulties I faced was making sure the data was sifted correctly and catagorized with the correct filters. Another difficulty was making sure my formulas were outputting the correct information. Lastly, one possible difficulty that I could have encountered would have been using incorrect data from the source. In other words, if the data that was given was incorrect from the start, then all of the visualizations and report(s) would be wrong. 
## Results
I can conclude two things about "Outcomes based on Launch Date." First, the most successful launch dates were conducted during the summer times. There could hundred of reason why. One inference I could make is that individuals during the summer might have more free time. The final conclusion I could make is that overall, there were more success than failures. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
One important conclusion I can make about "Outcomes based on Goals" is that the pledges made $20,000 or less were the most successful. There could many reasons why they were successful. I believe one could have been attributed to incomes level, demographically. 

There are a few limitions of this dataset such as:
1. Self-reported data( Is the information correct) may or may not be accurate.
2. Missing data(It looked there could have been missing information from the data set).
3. Limited access to date. There could have been more sufficent data out there that could have make the data visualization more bennfical, but was not acquired.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
For there this paritcular data I could have utilized pie charts or bar graphs. I would like to have utilized pie charts to help visualzie the disparity between successful outcomes of launch dates.
